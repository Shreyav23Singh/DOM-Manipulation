** Window.localStorage **
==>  The localStorage read-only property of the interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's Origin ; the stored data is saved across the browser
     sessions.
     
 ==>  LocalStorage is similar to sessionStorage , except that while localStorage data has no expiration time , sessionStorage data cleared when the page sessions ends i.e, 
    when the page is closed.
 
 ==>  The keys and the values stored with localStorage are always in the UTF-16 string format , which uses two bytes per character.As with objects , integer keys are automatically 
      converted to strings.
